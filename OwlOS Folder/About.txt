OwlOS is already optimized after installation, so you don't have to do practically anything.
All you need to do is install the browser from "Browser" folder and graphics driver from "GPU Drivers". 
Alternatively, you can enable or disable features you need, using the scripts located in the "Services and Features" folder. 
If you have a little more knowledge, you can also use the programs located in the "Tools" folder.
